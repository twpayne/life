Life
====


This repository contains a number of different implementations of the [Conway's
Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) that I
worked on with fellow developers during the [Global Day of Coderetreat
2012](http://gathers.us/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2012-cern-geneva-switzerland)
at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.

The examples have been cleaned up a bit from the various 45-minute sessions.
